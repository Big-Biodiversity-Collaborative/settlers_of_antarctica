Assignment 2_2 - Functions and Iteration 

Use the fish tank data we've been working with (https://tinyurl.com/tbyskxl). 

Using the methodology for building functions and iteration that we've learned in
the last two classes, build a script that:
1) follows best coding practices and formatting 
2) Creates a function that generates a 15 sample mean of temperature from a 
normal distribution where the mean is 75ยบ F and there is high variability (e.g.
sd = 4).
3) Using the sample() function, sample 15 random temperatures of tilapia tanks. 
4) Compare the mean of this vector to the mean from your function 
(remember, you'll need to convert from celsius to farenheit, or vice 
versa here). 
5) Create a loop (or loops) that generates this 15-tank comparison 100 times. 
6) Summarize these data in a meaningful way - either through plots, text or 
both.
