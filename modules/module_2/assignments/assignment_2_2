Assignment 2-2

Submit a script that uses the fish tank data (https://tinyurl.com/tbyskxl). 
The script should perform the following actions:
1) Write a function that replicates the same sampling procedure we developed to
sample the number of sick fish in a given tank, except sample tank temperature. 
2) The script should follow proper formatting guidelines and best coding 
practices we've discussed. 
3) Sample for each species separately (you can include this in your function, 
or run the function twice on two filtered data sets). 
4) Report the 5-sample mean temperature for each species. 
5) Briefly, in a commented sentence at the end of the script, judge whether this
mean value is below the physiological threshold for immunsuppresion that we 
discussed (for each species).
