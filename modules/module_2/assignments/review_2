Module 2 Review/Practice

Data: https://tinyurl.com/yg886rqz

This dataset will allow you practice the main things we covered in this section:
1. Basic plotting (scatter plots and histograms)
2. Making functions
3. Iterating using loops
4. Simulations

Data summary: The aquaculture scientists on team antarctica have been working on
developing a new diet for tilapia based on soy-protein, and are interested in 
whether incorporating this into fish diets will result in faster growth rates. 
They've provided us with this data to analyze. 

Main questions: 
1) Is the average tank temperature different than what we would expect from a 
320-tank sample based on our pre-defined assumptions of 75ยบ F average tank temp?
(sd = 2, mean = 75). 
2) Does an increase in soy protein percentage correlate with a bigger day-30 weight
for Tilapia?
3) Does temperature have any effect on day 30 weight?
4) What is your reccomendation to the aquaculture team?
