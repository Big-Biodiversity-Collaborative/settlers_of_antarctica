# Conclusions, our medians are the same, but our simulation isn't really 
# matching what we're seeing when we sample the data... much more spread. But 
# the main take home here is that there isn't a big difference in the average
# tank temperature from our simulation, where it's sitting tightly around 75ยบ F.
