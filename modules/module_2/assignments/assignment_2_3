Examining other folks' code is a key tool in the DS toolkit - it's often frustrating, 
but you invariably learn new things every time you do it. Code poaching is fair game, 
just make sure to comment/cite where stuff came from!

1) Read through the article, and give a brief (less than 100 word) summary of 
what the authors are trying to convey. 
2) Focus on one of the examples, specifically outline the problem (100 words or less)
3) Try running the code for yourself. 
4) Identify 2 new things you learned from this code that we haven't covered in class
5) Identify 2 things you don't understand about the code and have questions about. 

(Please reference line numbers in the code when specifying parts 4 and 5 above).
