## Group Project  
We've covered a lot so far in this module - basic plotting, data exploration, 
simulation, functions, iteration. Now it's time to start putting it all together.  

Last time, we decided that tank temperatures weren't that different between 
tanks with large amounts of sick fish and those without. Now it's time to figure 
out if there are any culprits at all.  

Your job today is to create a script and present analyses that do the following:  
1. Examine other factors that may be the cause of the disease outbreak.  
2. Use whatever tools you'd like (simulation, functions, plots, summaries)
3. Be prepared to present your findings to your classmates and convince them 
that you know what the root of the problem is.
