Assignment 4-1

Use the same dataset on penguine nesting sites (https://tinyurl.com/w9tol83) to 
build a script that accomplishes the following tasks:
1. Follows best practices for formatting and commenting that we've worked on 
throughout the semester
2. Loads in the penguin nesting data we've been working with in class
3. Answer the following questions: 1) How many individual 
penguin chicks are present in the data (this isn't neccesarily the number of 
rows in the data set - some chicks may be counted twice). Think about combining 
the length() and unique() functions. 
4. Using the dplyr tools we've developed, generate a summary data set that 
shows the mean distance to open water and the number of samples for each site. 
5.
