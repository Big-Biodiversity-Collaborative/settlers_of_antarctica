Assignment 4-3
For this last assignment, we'll do a bit of practice with multiple regression 
and thinking about the penguin-predicament we've found ourselves in. 
You'll be working with the second set of data from this module 
(https://tinyurl.com/yardhofj). Build a script that accomplishes the following 
tasks: 
1. Follows best practices for formatting and documentation that we've 
discussed over the course of the semester. 
2. Imports the site data from the URL above and does a quick summary on the 
data that computes the average distance to water for 1971 and 2011 
(using any means you'd like). 
3. Performs a multiple regression that examines the relationship between the 
number of nests as a function of distance to water with year as an interactive 
effect. 
4. Plots the equivalent relationship above and provides a succinct description 
of the relationship. 
5. We're at a standstill here - what do we do? Is there another approach that 
you can think of that might work better? How do we make a decision about what 
nesting sites to build our road through and which to save (4-5 sentences).
