# each row is data from a single site for a single year
# vars - #tussocks, distance to water, year (1991, 2011), #nests, avg_stone_size
# Major patterns in data:
# 1. More tussocks/m2 in 2011 than in 1971 (on average)
# 2. Distance to open water decreases between 1971 and 2011
# 3. Number of nests is non-linear with stone size
# 4. More tussocks = more nests
