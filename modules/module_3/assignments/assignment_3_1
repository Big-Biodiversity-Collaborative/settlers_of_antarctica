Assignment 3-1

In this assignment, we're going to explore another data set on wind turbines 
that generate a significant portion of the energy for us down here in 
Antarctica. You can explore the dataset generated from team-turbine at 
https://tinyurl.com/rhzt35r

Your assignment with these data is the following:
1. Create an R script using coding best practices discussed in class
2. Load in the data and do a quick quality control check - answer the following
questions: 1) How many turbine makers are there? 2) what do you think each 
column of data represents? 
3. Generate a summary of the data set that calculates the mean wind speed, mean 
power, maximum power and power variance for each turbine maker. Answer the 
following question: Which turbine maker has a higher average power output?
4. Generate a boxplot using ggplot syntax that compares the windspeed between 
different turbine makers. The plot should 1) be appropriately labeled, 2) show 
raw data points in addition to the boxes (look at the geom_jitter() function).
5. What do all of the different components of a box-plot represent (Google this
). Give a concise 4-5 sentence summary where you break down each piece and what
 it represents.
