Assignment 3-2

In this assignment, we're going to further explore the data set on wind turbines 
that generate a significant portion of the energy for us down here in 
Antarctica. You can explore the dataset generated from team-turbine at 
https://tinyurl.com/rhzt35r

For this assignment, generate an R script that: 
1) Performs two t-tests on the two different variables (wind speed and power output) by turbine maker. 
2. Briefly in your script, describe what the goal is here (in plain English). Why are we running these tests? 
3. In your script - describe each part of the output from the t.test: t, df, p-value, 95% confidence interval, sample estimates. What does each mean, and what does it tell us here?
4. Write a one-sentence summary at the end of your script that describes the overall finding with these tests?
