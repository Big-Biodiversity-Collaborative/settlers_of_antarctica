### 1a. Why do visualizations matter? - Small Group Activity

  * Take 3 minutes individuals - write down your top 10 reasons why data visualization is important or useful to you?
  * Take 5 minutes with your group - compare your notes, come to a group consensus - rank the top 5 reasons from the group.
  * Have your *Presenter* write the group's reasons on the board, and we'll spend some time discussing.
  
### 1b. Types of visualization - big thinking about data

#### 1b.1 Small group activity  
  Within your group - what are all of the types of visualization you can think of. The Conceptor will draw them initially, then I'll draw them on the board during a speak out.  
  

#### 1b.2 Activity - matching data types to visualization types  
  Matching activity in group - can you match the visualization to the data type. 
  
  File for activity is in the images folder. 

### 1c Figure Critique - What makes a good data visualization?
  * Small mini-lecture on principles of data visualization and design.

  * Students will examine and critique figures from primary literature in their groups. Each group will be passed a figure, students will take 10 minutes to try to interpret the figure, and generate a list of problems. Each group will also draw and present a reimagined version of the figure that is better.
