Learning Outcome: Share decision making process in light of uncertainty and ambiguity

Most of your life you will have incomplete information to make a decision, even a really important one such as: should I say yes to this job in New York, should I ask this person to marry me, should I have kids? Turns out this is made even harder since humans really do not like uncertainty, we have a hard time when our expectations do not meet our predictions. The world is full of uncertainty, and you have to learn to deal with it as best you can, and learn to make the most out of the limited information you have now and in the future

How do you make decisions when you do not have all the information? What seems to work, what doesn't? How do you feel and cope when your expectations are not met?
